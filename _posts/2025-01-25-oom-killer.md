## Linux OOM Killer

The kernel has a mechanism called oomkiller (out-of-memory killer) to allow killing a single process. Killer is summoned when the system runs short of free memory and is unable to proceed without killing one or more processes. [Kernel Doc](https://www.kernel.org/doc/gorman/html/understand/understand016.html) Modern systems allow overcommit, meaning kernel allows more memory to a process that it can gurantee. When many of the process consume the overcommitted memory, kernel can either panic or start killing some of its childen. A Real word example to understand this, flights do [overbooking](https://www.britannica.com/story/why-do-airlines-overbook-seats-on-flights). Here they dont kill the passengers, instead they offer better deals to the passengers who are willing to opt out.

This can be controlled by the flag called `/proc/sys/vm/panic_on_oom`. Set it to 1, the kernel will panic instead of killing the process. Otherwise, it will call the OOM killer(default).

So for every PID there's a score maintained for "fair" termination of the processes.
  
* `/proc/[pid]/oom_score`
  
   View the OOM-killer score of your process. A higher score means that the process is more likely to be selected by the OOM-killer.
   e.g

    
    ```shell
	root@raspberrypi:/home/pi# cat /proc/3202/oom_score
	668
    ```

* `/proc/[pid]/oom_score_adj`

    Adjust the badness heuristic to select which process gets killed in out-of-memory conditions. (oom_adj in older versions) So if you want to exclude your process, this is the knob for you.

The kernel function [select_bad_process()](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/mm/oom_kill.c#L364) is responsible for choosing a process to kill. When the OOM killer is invoked, it tries to pick the process whose demise will free the most memory while causing the least misery for users of the system.

Processes which have been running a long time are unlikely to be the cause of memory shortage so this calculation is likely to select a process that uses a lot of memory but has not been running long. There are of course un-killable processes like init, PF_KTHREAD, etc.


OOM badness calculation algorigthm was heavily debated. In the begining, it was not considering namespaces. Lets say, When user A runs a large process & B runs 100 small processes, it'd target the userA's process, even if B is using far more.
So for environments where the processes are grouped into [cgroups](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/cgroups.7.html), they introduced control-group aware OOM killers to solve this problem.

- Find the largest memory consuming cgroup

- Find the largest process runing within the group is killed

- `memory.oom_group` kill all the process inside the cgroup

### Kubernetes OOM Kill

You might have seen pods getting restarted due to  oomkills, This is done by the Kubelet agent that monitors the container's memory usage , a metric called `container_memory_working_set_bytes` is used to determine a container memory usage and if it goes beyond its defined limits, the container is oomKilled. Pods in fact are not oomkilled.
