### Reflection

1. **Take your time**: Don't rush through the any reads. Take your time to read, reflect, and think about each chapter or paragraph thouroughly. Remember we're not in a race.
   
2. **Engage with the material**: As you read, ask yourself questions like: "What is the main argument?" "What are the author's assumptions?" "How does this relate to my own experiences or perspectives?"
   
3. **Analyze and evaluate**: As you read, analyze and evaluate the arguments presented in the book. Think about the strengths and weaknesses of each argument.
   
4. **Practice what you learn**:  Practice what you learn. Apply the concepts and techniques you're learning to real-life situations. This will help solidify your understanding and make it more practical. 

The most important things is to enjoy the process of reading and learning, if you're not enjoying it, you may never finish reading it. It will be just a read-later article or a bookmark you'll never visit again or a book that eats dust in the shelf and thats fine. Otherwise whats the point of it all?
